Your brief is to create Jupyter Notebook that provides some insightful summary of the contents of the data set using the methods covered in the unit including (but not necessarily all of)
    
•	    Loading, formatting and scaling data

•	    Making new features (combining / aggregating variables)

•	    Summarising variables (means, distributions, data types)

•	    Plotting data

•	    Segregating/Filtering data

•	    Investigating the relationships between variables

•	    Building predictive models


Including a summary of the data, you could then consider one or more of the following
(*provided as guide, investigate anything you think may be interesting!)


**Are there are notable differences between categories?**


**Can you model you use one or more variables to predict another, or demonstrate a relationship between two or more variables?**

**Can you build a model that predicts a categorical class for a new example?**
*Remember, continuous  variables can be made categorical through thresholding


**Does the data cluster into recognisable groups without the need for labels?**


**Can you identify any trends over time (if date information is available?)**
